// Day 2: Operators

// ACTIVITY - 1 Arithmetic Operations.
// Task:1 write a program  to add two numbers and log the result to the console.

let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 20;
console.log('Two numbers sum is:-> ', num1 + num2);

// Task:2 write a program  to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.

console.log(`Two numbers subtraction is:-> ${num2 - num1} and the number 1st is ${num2} and number 2nd is ${num1}`);

// Task:3 write a program  to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.

console.log(`Two numbers multiplication is:-> ${num2 * num1} and the number 1st is ${num2} and number 2nd is ${num1}`);

// Task:4 write a program  to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.

console.log(`Two numbers division is:-> ${num2 / num1} and the number 1st is ${num2} and number 2nd is ${num1}`);

// Task:5 write a program  to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

console.log(`The Remainder is:-> ${num1 % num2} and the number 1st is ${num1} and number 2nd is ${num2}`);


// ACTIVITY - 2 Assignment Operators.
// Task:6 Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.

console.log(`The Result of += operator is:-> ${num1 += num2}`);

// Task:7 Use the -= operator to subtract a number to a variable and log the result to the console.

console.log(`The Result of -= operator is:-> ${num1 -= num2}`);


// ACTIVITY - 3 Comparison Operators.
// Task:8 write a program  to campare  two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.

console.log(`Campare between ${num1} to ${num2} first with > and the result is:-> ${num1 > num2}. Now campare with < and the result is:-> ${num1 < num2}`);

// Task:9 write a program  to campare  two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.

console.log(`Campare between ${num1} to ${num2} first with >= and the result is:-> ${num1 >= num2}. Now campare with <= and the result is:-> ${num1 <= num2}`);

// Task:10 write a program  to campare  two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.

console.log(`Campare between ${num1} to ${num2} first with == and the result is:-> ${num1 == num2}. Now campare with === and the result is:-> ${num1 === num2}`);


// ACTIVITY - 4 Logical Operators.
// Task:11,12,13 write a program  that uses the && operator to combine two condition  and log the result to the console.

console.log(`Campare between two conditions fist is ${true} and another is ${false} and the result is:-> ${true && false}. And now campare with || and the result is:-> ${true || false}. And now using ! and the result is:-> ${!true} `);

// ACTIVITY - 5 Ternary Operators.
// Task:14 write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

console.log(`Ternary operator result is:-> The number ${num1} is ${num1 > 0 ? 'positive' : 'negative'}.`);
