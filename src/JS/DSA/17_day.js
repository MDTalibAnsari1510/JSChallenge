// Day 17: Data Structures

// ACTIVITY - 1 Linked List
// Task:1 Implement Node class to represent an element in a linked list with properties value and next.

// Task:2 Implement LinkedList class with methods to add a node to the end, remove a node from the end, and display all nodes.



// ACTIVITY - 2 Stack
// Task:3 Implement stack class with methods push(add element) pop(remove element) and peek(view the top element).

// Task:4 Use the Stack class to reverse a string by pushing all character onto the stack and then popping them off.



// ACTIVITY - 3 Queue
// Task:5 Implement Queue class with methods enqueue(add element), dequeue(remove element), and front(view element).

// Task:6 Use the Queue class to simulate a simple printer queue where print jobs are added ti the queue and processed in order.



// ACTIVITY - 4 Binary Tree
// Task:7 Implement a TreeNode class to represent a node in a binary tree with properties value, left, and right.

// Task:8 Implement a BinaryTree class with methods for inserting values and performing in-order traversal to display nodes.



// ACTIVITY - 5 Graph (Optional)
// Task:9 Implement a Graph class with methods to add vertices, add edges, and perform a breadth-first search (BSF).

// Task:10 Use the Graph class to represent a simple network and perform (BSF) to find the shortest path between two nodes.
