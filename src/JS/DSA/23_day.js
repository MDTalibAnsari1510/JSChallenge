// Day 23: LeetCode Hard

// ACTIVITY - 1 Median of Two Sorted Array 
// Task:1 Solve the "Median of Two Sorted Array" Problem on LeetCode.
//      Write a function that takes two sorted array of integer and returns the median of the two sorted arrays.
//      Log the median for a few test cases, including edge cases.


// ACTIVITY - 2 Merge K Sorted List 
// Task:2 Solve the "Merge K Sorted List" Problem on LeetCode.
//      Write a function that takes an array of k linked list is sorted in ascending order, and merges all the linked lists into one sorted linked list.
//      Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the merged list.


// ACTIVITY - 3 Trapping Rain water
// Task:3 Solve the "Trapping Rain water" Problem on LeetCode.
//      Write a function that takes an array of non-nagtive integers an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, and computes how much water it can trap after raining.
//      Log the amount of trapped water for a few test cases.


// ACTIVITY - 4 N-Queens
// Task:4 Solve the "N-Queens" Problem on LeetCode.
//      Write a function that places n queens on an n*n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other, and returns all distinct solutions of n-queens puzzle.
//      Log the distinct solutions for a few test cases.


// ACTIVITY - 5 Word Ladder
// Task:5 Solve the "Word Ladder" Problem on LeetCode.
//      Write a function that takes a begin word, an end word, and a dictionary of words, and finds the length of the shortest transformation sequence from the begin word to the end word, such that only one letter can be changed at a time and each transformed word must exist in the word list.
//      Log the length of the shortest transformation sequence for a few test cases.
