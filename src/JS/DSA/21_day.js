// Day 21: LeetCode Easy

// ACTIVITY - 1 Two Sum
// Task:1 Solve the "Two Sum" Problem on LeetCode.
//      Write a function that takes an array of numbers and a target number, and returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
//      Log the indices for a few test cases.



// ACTIVITY - 2 Reverse Integer
// Task:2 Solve the "Reverse Integer" Problem on LeetCode.
//      Write a function that takes an integer and returns it with its digit reversed.
//      Handle edge cases like negative numbers and numbers ending in zero.
//      Log the reversed integer for a few test cases.


// ACTIVITY - 3 Palindrome Number
// Task:3 Solve the "Palindrome Number" Problem on LeetCode.
//      Write a function that takes an integer and returns true if it is palindrome, and false otherwise.
//      Log the result for a few test cases, including edge cases like nagative numbers.


// ACTIVITY - 4 Merge Two Sorted Lists
// Task:4 Solve the "Merge Two Sorted Lists" Problem on LeetCode.
//      Write a function that takes two sorted linked lists and returns a new sorted list by merging them.
//      Create a few test cases, with linked lists and log the merge list.


// ACTIVITY - 5 Valid Parantheses
// Task:4 Solve the "Valid Parantheses" Problem on LeetCode.
//      Write a function that takes string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{','}','[', and ']', and determines if the input sting is valid.
